# Shopify Integration

After successful data ingestion, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to Home page in the side panel.
2. You can see **"Widget Code"** 
    
    You will get a JS script that looks like this:
    

```jsx
<script src="<https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@nextai/searchmate@0.1.4/build/static/js/main.js?key=2afxxxxxxxxxxxxxx>"></script>
```

Copy the code.

1. Navigate to your Shopify store admin panel.
    1. Click on **"Online Store"**.
    2. From there, click on **"Customize"**.
    3. On the top, you will find a three dots option **(...)**, click on that.
    4. Click **"Edit Code"**.
    5. Find **'theme.liquid'** or use the search bar to filter.
    6. Paste the copied script code at the bottom of the `theme.liquid` file where the `</script>` tag ends.
